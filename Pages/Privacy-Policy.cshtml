        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Data Collection and Usage</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            The ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX may collect various types of data, including but not limited to personal information, sales reports, inventory updates, feedback, and survey responses. The specific data fields are defined by the owner of the ZERiX SMS system—typically an Optimum's client—based on their unique requirements.
        </div>
        
        <div class="privacy-text">
            All collected data is securely stored within the ZERiX SMS platform, hosted on the client's own server and through MyZERiX—where clients have exclusive access to their data. Access to this data is granted only to authorized users as designated by the client.
        </div>
        
        <div class="privacy-text">Collected data may be used for purposes such as:</div>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
            <li>Updating existing records</li>
            <li>Monitoring sales and performance trends</li>
            <li>Managing inventory reports</li>
            <li>Gathering feedback and survey results to enhance customer service</li>
            <li>Any other business use authorized by the Optimum client</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="privacy-text">
            As the data sender, you may request a copy of your submitted data directly from Optimum's client hosting the ZerixText SMS system. Additionally, as an authorized user, you have the ability to view, track, and retrieve all messages you've sent and received through your account inbox.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">How We Use Information</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            The primary purpose of the ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX is to facilitate easy data collection. While we may have visibility into submitted data, it is used strictly for reporting purposes. We do not share, sell, or transfer your information to any third party.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Cookies</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            Cookies are small files containing data that serve as anonymous unique identifiers. They are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and are stored in your device's internal memory.
        </div>
        
        <div class="privacy-text">
            The ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX does not use cookies directly. However, please note that the app may include third-party libraries or code that use cookies to collect information and improve their services.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Security</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            We highly value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, and we are committed to using commercially acceptable methods to protect it. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </div>
        
        <div class="privacy-text">
            Since your data is stored on the server of Optimum's client, the primary responsibility for implementing security measures lies with the client. It is also the user's responsibility to ensure that the security measures adopted by the client are acceptable and meet their standards for data protection.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Account Authentication</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            To access the ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX, users must log in using a username and password, which is provided by Optimum's client of the ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX. This ensures that only authorized users can access and interact with the data.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">SQL Injection Protection</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            The ZERiX SMS platform and MyZERiX uses direct queries to its databases. To safeguard against SQL injection attacks, our source code has been secured with protection measures that help maintain the integrity and safety of your data.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Database Encryption</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            The system uses a SQLite database with encrypted passwords. Access to the database is restricted— before any data can be viewed, the system requires users to enter a valid encryption key, adding an extra layer of security.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Changes to This Privacy Policy</div>
        <div class="privacy-text">
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about any changes. Any updates to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page, and all changes will take effect immediately upon posting.
